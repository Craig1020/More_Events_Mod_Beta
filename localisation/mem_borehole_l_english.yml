 mem_borehole_category:0 "Hole in the ground"
 mem_borehole_category_desc:0 "Surface imaging has revealed a long vertical shaft in the planet's crust. Precisely right angle and unusually smooth surface suggest artificial origin."
  
 mem_borehole.1.name:0 "Abandoned Deep Mine"
 mem_borehole.1.desc:0 "§Y[Root.GetLeaderName]§! reports that the installation is some kind of deep mine, designed to extract minerals from the deeper levels of planet's crust. The mine is deactivated, but with the minimal repairs it can be brought back online."
 mem_borehole.1a:0 "Repair the equipment."
 mem_borehole.1b:0 "Disassemble the equipment to learn its secrets."
 mem_borehole.1c:0 "Salvage the borehole equipment."
 
mem_borehole.2.name:0 "Rare Minerals Survey"
 mem_borehole.2.desc:0 "It appears the shaft was designed to breach a large deposit of a rare ore. However, just as they reached the goal, the project was abandoned for reasons unknown."
 mem_borehole.2a:0 "We should look into their findings."
 mem_borehole.2b:0 "Looks like they found garanthium."
 
 mem_borehole.3.name:0 "Missile Silo"
 mem_borehole.3.desc:0 "At the bottom of the very deep shaft science team had found an enormous rocket outfitted with the biggest thermonuclear warhead in our records. §Y[Root.GetLeaderName]§!, however, suggests that this is not, in fact, a weapon but a novelty project of a sort, since its mass, material composition and structure makes it impossible to lift-off, let alone achieve escape velocity without falling apart. Some of the design choices are still very interesting, however."
 mem_borehole.3a:0 "We should study the rocket."
 
 mem_borehole.4.name:0 "A Habitat"
 mem_borehole.4.desc:0 "On the inspection, the shaft's walls were found to be composed of thousands of small self-sustaining pods outfitted with life-support system. Most of them were either scrubbed clean or never inhabited to begin with, but some still have items scattered inside, suggesting inhabitants have left in a hurry. Unusual architectural choice and design of the pods could be a subject for an interesting study."
 mem_borehole.4a:0 "We should look into it."
 
 mem_borehole.5.name:0 "Sludge Deposit"
 mem_borehole.5.desc:0 "Initial observation had shown the shaft to be almost entirely filled with with high-energy radioactive sludge. It was likely a dumping site for some planet's worth of industrial pollution. §Y[Root.GetLeaderName]§! refuses to advance further, citing [Leader.GetHerHis] lack of faith in our hazardous material protection technology's ability to save [Leader.GetHerHim] and [Leader.GetHerHis] team from this "crime against nature"."
 mem_borehole.5a:0 "Disgusting. But curious."
 
 mem_borehole.6.name:0 "Race To The Bottom"
 mem_borehole.6.desc:0 "The science team had examined the borehole. Judging by the wall texture, it was carved with a powerful laser installation and appears to be reaching the planet's molten core without striking any particularly useful deposit. Nearby, §Y[Root.GetLeaderName]§! had located a small transmitter that has long since ran out of energy. Preliminary analysis of its databanks suggests it was meant to broadcast a message on repeat across the galaxy bragging about reaching the planet's molten core ahead of competitors."
 mem_borehole.6a:0 "Congratulations, probably."
 
 mem_borehole.7.name:0 "Nothing of Value Found"
 mem_borehole.7.desc:0 "§Y[Root.GetLeaderName]§! reports that while the shaft is definitely an artificial borehole, it was scrapped clean, with no useful technology or mineral deposits to be recovered."
 
 
 mem_borehole.8.name:0 "It's A Trap!"
 mem_borehole.8.desc:0 "While exploring the borehole on [From.GetName], §Y[Root.GetLeaderName]§! has apparently triggered some kind of booby trap, causing the entire structure to collapse, killing [Leader.GetHerHim] and most of [Leader.GetHerHis] team."
