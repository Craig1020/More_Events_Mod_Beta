 mem_artifact.52.name:0 "Traces of an Ancient Past"
 mem_artifact.52.desc:0 "Our away team entered the station, the place is desolate and appears to have been long since abandoned. The structure is made up of small enclosed rooms with corridors of varying heights, which is hampering progress. We eventually managed to restore power to some minor systems in what we suspect to be a control room and have unearthed several pieces of information about this solar system and the research conducted here. The most important being a central object in the system and three research facilities in the nearby vicinity containing similiar artifacts.  Acquiring these three "ciphers" as they are called should be our priority if we plan to further study the main object. On the other hand some of our scientists suggested to not waste time with such a paper chase and trying our luch with the main object immediatly."
 mem_artifact.52.a:0 "These "ciphers" seem to be there for a reason. Find them."
 mem_artifact.52.b:0 "They are right. Let's not waste any more time."
 
 mem_artifact.53:0 "The Relic"
 mem_artifact.53.desc:0 "Unlike anything we have seen before this strange object silently floats amidst the nebula. Only faint energy emmisions are readable. Our scientists are ready to begin the prepared activation procedure. But yet again there is discord amonst their ranks. While some of them are eager to start at a moments notice others still remain reluctant reminding that we are dealing with unknown and ancient technology. Maybe we should try to acquire the "ciphers" first before blindly rushing into whatever dark secrets this relic might hold."
 mem_artifact.53.a:0 "On a second thought maybe we should search them first."
 mem_artifact.53.b:0 "Just do it! Don't waste any more time."
