The structure is made up of small enclosed rooms with corridors of varying heights, which is hampering progress. We eventually managed to restore power to some minor systems in what we suspect to be a control room and have unearthed several pieces of information about this system. The most important being a central object in the system and three research facilities in the nearby vicinity. We will have the co-ordinates entered into our navigational computers."
