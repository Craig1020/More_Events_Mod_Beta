 mem_stuck_in_glacier_category:0 "Stuck in a Glacier"
 mem_stuck_in_glacier_desc:0 "A small foreign object detected within glacier on planet's surface."
 
 mem_stuck_in_glacier.10.name:0 "Kinetic Projectile"
 mem_stuck_in_glacier.10.desc:0 "Preliminary observation identified the object as a large kinetic artillery round, apparently shot at the planet in distant past. Evidently, some ship launched it from high orbit causing it to penetrate about 50 meters of ice before stopping. Technology that allowed it to survive the impact might be quite useful."
 mem_stuck_in_glacier.10a:0 "Find a way to recover the object."
 mem_stuck_in_glacier.10b:0 "We are not drilling glacier for a piece of junk."

 mem_stuck_in_glacier.20.name:0 "Robot"
 mem_stuck_in_glacier.20.desc:0 "It appears, a robotic unit of a sort was placed within glacier. Judging by scarring and refreezing patterns on the glacial surface, it was thrown from planet's high orbit and penetrated the glacier under the impact velocity and heat from re-entry through thin, but not non-existent atmosphere."
 mem_stuck_in_glacier.20a:0 "We should recover it."
 mem_stuck_in_glacier.20b:0 "We are not drilling glacier for a piece of junk."
 mem_stuck_in_glacier.20c:0 "Let the abominable machine lie dead."
 
 mem_stuck_in_glacier.30.name:0 "Dead explorer"
 mem_stuck_in_glacier.30.desc:0 "The object sensors picked up initially turned out to be a sealed exo-suit with its occupant, member of a species unknown to us, still inside. Judging by the damage sustained by the suit, someone had repeatedly bashed the suit's visor with a large rock until its integrity was compromised, and after its user suffocated, threw the body into a crevasse. Both suit technology and corpse inside could be of major use for us."
 mem_stuck_in_glacier.30a:0 "At least someone could now tell their story."
 mem_stuck_in_glacier.30b:0 "Looks like the xeno will be of some use after all."
 
 mem_stuck_in_glacier.40.name:0 "Crashed supply shuttle"
 mem_stuck_in_glacier.40.desc:0 "[Leader.GetName] surprised to report that the object found on site, is one of our own supply shuttles. This particular shuttle had went off the grid a few months ago during a scheduled flight. Flight recorder in the cockpit contains a message from the pilot where he blames [Owner.GetAdj] society's lack of appreciation for him and [Owner.GetRulerTitle] [Owner.GetRulerName]'s name conspiracy to persecute him in particular as main reasons to steal and crash the shuttle."
 mem_stuck_in_glacier.40a:0 "Tragic."
 mem_stuck_in_glacier.40:0 "What a waste of government's property."
 
 mem_stuck_in_glacier.50.name:0 "A meteorite"
 mem_stuck_in_glacier.50.desc:0 "The team sent on site had found a lump of meteorite iron inside the glacier. Judging by its composition, it might be extragalactic in origin, travelling for aeons until being caught in planet's gravity and eventually crashed on its surface, remaining shallowly burrowed for some more aeons."
 mem_stuck_in_glacier.50a:0 "Such is the great journey of life."

 mem_stuck_in_glacier.60.name:0 "Data cache"
 mem_stuck_in_glacier.60.desc:0 "§Y(We haven't done it yet, how you got here?)§!\n\n Apparently, someone had melted a spot in the glacier, before placing a small navigational computer inside and letting the water re-freeze. Whatever is hidden there might be of value."
 mem_stuck_in_glacier.60a:0 "It could be useful."

 mem_stuck_in_glacier.99.name:0 "Just a Rock"
 mem_stuck_in_glacier.99.desc:0 "The "object" detected within planet's glacier was revealed to be a simple boulder, stuck inside. Its unusual shape and composition produced abnormal readings, but is of no interest beyond that."

 MEM_STUCK_IN_GLACIER_PROJECTILE_PROJECT:0 "Recover kinetic projectile from the glacier"
 MEM_STUCK_IN_GLACIER_PROJECTILE_PROJECT_DESC:0 "A stray orbital shot had penetrated planetary glacier and is currently embedded at about 50 meters deep. We could melt ice and recover it for study, but it will take time"
 
 MEM_STUCK_IN_GLACIER_ROBOT_PROJECT:0 "Recover a robot from the glacier"
 MEM_STUCK_IN_GLACIER_ROBOT_PROJECT_DESC:0 "Somebody had dumped a robot on a frozen planet. We could cut it out of ice, but it will take time"
 
 MEM_STUCK_IN_GLACIER_CACHE_PROJECT:0 "Recover the glacier cache"
 MEM_STUCK_IN_GLACIER_CACHE_PROJECT_DESC:0 "Somebody has deliberately placed an object deep within glacier. We should find a way to cut it out"
 
 mem_stuck_in_glacier.11.name:0 "Successful recovery: Worthless find"
 mem_stuck_in_glacier.11.desc:0 "After the long and difficult dig, [Leader.GetName] reports that the round was not of any value. All design solutions apparent we could possibly copy are already available to us."

 mem_stuck_in_glacier.12.name:0 "Successful recovery: Reinforced rounds"
 mem_stuck_in_glacier.12.desc:0 "[Leader.GetName] had successfully recovered and examined the projectile. It appears to utilize some unusual layered composition that allowed it better penetration and increased impact energy."
 mem_stuck_in_glacier.12a:0 "Good job."
 
 mem_stuck_in_glacier.13.name:0 "Successful recovery: High calibre"
 mem_stuck_in_glacier.13.desc:0 "Upon recovery and examination high calibre of a round becomes the most notable feature. It suggested certain solutions to weapon technology that might open us new possibilities of extra heavy weaponry."
 mem_stuck_in_glacier.13a:0 "Good job."
 mem_stuck_in_glacier.13b:0 "We have already mastered this technology"
 
 mem_stuck_in_glacier.21.name:0 "Successful recovery: Robot is badly damaged"
 mem_stuck_in_glacier.21.desc:0 "[Leader.GetName] reports that [Leader.GetHerHis] team's lack of familiarity with alien technology had caused irrepairable damage during recovery operation. The unit is now only good for scrap metal."
 mem_stuck_in_glacier.21a:0 "Scrap metal it is, then."
